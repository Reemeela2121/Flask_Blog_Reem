# Get to know me!

## Things I'm passionate about

 -  I'm passionate about making period products accessible in public spaces like schools and universities, and reducing the stigma surrounding menstruation. I am currently working on a project that is creating a low-cost solution for schools to provide tampons and pads through automatic dispensers in bathrooms. Currently, 5 states have passed laws requiring schools to provide free pads and tampons to their students. My team and I at TamPal are working with schools to make period products as ubiquitous as toilet paper in bathrooms! 
 - I am also passionate about developing in Q# and getting more people hype about quantum computing. I am currently working on expanding Q#'s debugging capabilities so people can understand their quantum programs better!

## My hobbies!

 -  My hobbies include fashion, photography, photo editing, sketching on Autodesk, as well as anything that involves creating art using
 unique mediums. I don't really consider myself an artist, but I love the fine arts! I also enjoy going out into nature and playing with my cat. I also love coming up with cool hacks to try at hackathons with my friends!
